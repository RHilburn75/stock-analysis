He wants to expand his research for his parents to expand the dataset to the entire stock market, but thinks it will take too long to execute.  We'll take the current dataset and see if we can get the same results, but faster!

    1. Look at the current code and data from the original code
    2. Show original code
    3. Provide the data from the original code
    4. Show refactored code
    5. 2017 / 2018 refactored stock performance
    6. Coding execution time - Original vs. Refactored
    
## Results


### Original Code

#### Original Code Data

#### Refactor Code
